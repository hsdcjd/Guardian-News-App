# Guardian Summary News App
(A DFA Challenge, February 2023)

### Task

A single page application in React that send requests to the Guardian API to get Headline and Article data and display them. 

### Serving your app

Use React's toolchain to take care of serving your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.

### Standard Criteria
```
As a busy politician
So I know what the big stories of the day are
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
```

```
As a busy politician
So that I have something nice to look at
I can see a relevant picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
```

### Extended

```
As a busy politician
Just in case my laptop breaks
I can read the site comfortably on my phone
```


## Mockups

### Headlines page

### Article summary page

### Guardian API example

If you wanted to get the content of an article from the Guardian API, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has a query parameter for `api-key`.

```sh
# Search endpoint
curl "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=coronavirus&show-fields=body&api-key=API_KEY"
```
```sh
# Single Item endpoint
curl "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/mar/22/link-between-diabetes-and-coronavirus-infections?show-fields=body&api-key=API_KEY"
```

#### Example request data

[Mock Data](./mockNewsData.json) - contains a request to the Guardian API with fields selected that will help you with the challenge.  The actual request made was to:

https://content.guardianapis.com/search?order-by=newest&show-fields=byline%2Cthumbnail%2Cheadline%2CbodyText&api-key=INSERT_YOUR_KEY_HERE

You will need to replace `INSERT_YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your own Guardian API key.  Use this data whilst developing, serving it from `json-server` - it will help on the request rate limit in the API.
